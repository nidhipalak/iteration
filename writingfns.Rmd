```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.height = 6,
  out.width = "90%")

theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))

options(
  ggplot2.continuous.colour = "viridis",
  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)

scale_color_discrete = scale_colour_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d
```

## Do something simple

```{r}
x_vec = rnorm(30, mean = 5, sd = 3)

(x_vec - mean(x_vec)) / sd(x_vec)
#The above is the z-score
```
The summary numbers here show the z-scores. 

I want a function to compute z score

```{r}
  #everything that happens between these{} brackets is the body of my function.
#The input of the fn is x, we named it already
z_score = function(x) {
 
 z = (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
  
  return(z)
  
}
# we named the z-score z, the return is z
z_score(x_vec)
```

Try my fn on some other things. These should giver errors

```{r, error = TRUE}
z_score(3)
#can compute the mean of 3, but cannot compute the sd, need more numbers to compute sd
z_score("my name is nidhi")
#can't do this either; cant take mean of character
z_score(mtcars)
#can't take the z-score of a data set
z_score(c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))
#this works bc it is logical and coerces it to 0's and 1's.
#each of these is something that causes my fn to break. 

```

Update my fn

```{r}
z_score = function(x) {
 if (!is.numeric(x)) {
   stop("Input must be numeric")
 }
  if (length(x) < 3) {
    stop("Input must have at least three numbers")
  }
 z = (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
  
  return(z)
}

z_score(x_vec)
```

Try fn again, should also give errors

```{r, error = TRUE}
z_score(3)
z_score("my name is nidhi")
z_score(mtcars)
z_score(c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))
#get input must be numeric!!!!!

```
